# django-project-structure
Welcome to the Django Project Structure Template repository! If you find yourself repeatedly using the same file structure for your Django projects and can't find a suitable template online, you're in the right place. This repository contains my preferred Django project structure, and I'm sharing it with the community in the hope that it might be useful for others too.

# How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-project-structure-template.git
2. Copy the Structure:
Copy the desired parts of the project structure into your new Django project.
3. Customize:
Modify the settings and structure to fit your project's specific requirements.
### Contributions

# Building and running your application with docker

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Deploying your application to the cloud

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.
